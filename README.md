# Course Project - CEIS209

## Background
This course project is designed to help you practice using your skills.  
Each week, you will learn important concepts.  Then, you will apply these concepts 
to build an amazing course project over the next seven weeks. This project 
will have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of using the console. This course 
project has two parts. For the first couple of weeks, you will create a basic GUI and 
learn how to work with GUI controls while practicing basic programming concepts. 
After that, you will create an object-oriented project.  

## Part 1: Scenario
Lucky you!  Your manager has put you in charge of the lyric videos for the monthly lip synch contest. 
Each contestant "sings" along with a song of their choice, prompted by the lyrics in the video.  
Essentially, there is a long list of songs, along with associated URLs and other information. 
Your manager has some basic functionality in mind, such as the ability to add and remove songs, as 
well as create playlists and show the videos.
